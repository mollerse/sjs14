# Making Math come alive with JavaScript

## Abstract

With the web becoming more powerful and supporting a wider range of technologies we are now facing a new frontier of user interaction, previously only possible using Flash or Silverlight.

The new tools at our disposal as frontend developers, CSS3 Transformations, SVG, Canvas and WebGL, all rely on linear algebra and trigonometry to make wonderous things happen.

This talk will take a class of transformations, known as affine transforms, make them come alive with JavaScript and show how we can leverage this mathematical sorcery to amaze and enthrall our users.
